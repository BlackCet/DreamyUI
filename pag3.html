    <h1>MY TEN HOURS</h1>
    <p>10 hours <br>
        that leafless tree <br>
        that flawless reflection in the puddle <br>
        the grey midwinters; didn't feel cold at all. <br>
        hazy scotch mist making out with the windowpane beside me <br>
        the urge to caress that flaunted palm. <br><br>
        Closed eyes; I see shadows; the obscurity <br>
        tempting me fathomlessly into your gravity<br>
        luring me to enter your trap doors<br>
        whispering you are hiding deep within this darkness,<br>
        dominating the control over ye and your matrix. <br><br>
        Illusioning yourself<br>
        into feeling secure in this otherwise uncertainty<br>
        Opening windows on certain truths, <br>
        concealing others behind heavy curtains <br>
        theorizing a frictionless life is equal to subtle death. <br>
        <br>
        Scared of being known. So now tell me your greatest fear<br>
        Will you trust me? What is your favourite color? <br>
        because it's rayless, Everthing is same in the dark. <br>
        <br>
        The self conscious yet comfortable silence; <br>
        symphonies ye played; caught me off guarded; knocked; <br>
        chocolates and coffee, well woven happenstance spell. <br>
        frisky exchanges, quick remarks, as if deflecting notes in secrecy. <br>
        Crimsoning the bleak back home, with a heart displaced <br>
        wondered if you'll ever realise, you got me mesmerized so hard. <br>
        Wishing it was the very first rhyme, <br>
        not where this poem does end. <br>
        My ink will witness your cue, till pending your fancy remains.<br>
        Some bullets were being held back as you were leaving the game. <br>
        <br>
        You got me so freeflowing; though in a merry go round<br>
        angling in snippets, hanging me imagining<br>
        Is that a craft you perfected? or are you being unalloyed? <br>
        All along you made me keep a count <br>
        whether it be of script, skids or the verse. <br>
        <br>
        Bright dawn put me to sleep, wondering who do you love <br>
        "Denial","It's complicated","It's all in your head", <br>
        which one would you nominate <br>
        Afraid of taking chances just to lose it all. <br>
        would it be simple or too complicated? <br>
        Oh, I'm really crazy thinking it all back <br>
        Or have I been just missing that writing on the wall? <br> <br>

        Soaring Infidelity, someone on my back, <br>
        A town so void, cages and fences <br>
        foggy streets and me a sore point. <br>
        Maybe you don't hear me, see you fading to black <br>
        You don't really wanna do this, I see you scrolling the chats<br>
        Fast asleep and eyes are open <br>
        catastrophising every moment. <br>
        Tired of going through the motions now. <br>
        Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop. <br> <br>

        Averting pretty eyes, slipping smirky smiles <br>
        So high above, so cool, sharp and oh gorgeous <br>
        Perfect and out of my league <br>
        Straight out of that anime, and expensive, I can't afford <br>
        But I can't say anything to your face. <br><br>

        You do me so vulnerable, it makes me so mad <br>
        Atleast think about the consequences of your magnetic field being a little too strong <br>
        Those ocean like eyes, straight into mine <br>
        I felt like I might drown and die <br>
        Mystery my boy, feelings intensified <br>
        lowkey can hear you in a noisy crowded room <br>
        saying, "I see you looking" and that wicked smile <br>
        First check on first look, feeling me out <br>
        Dilated pupil on second, pulling me like black hole <br>
        your blunt, your pace, the voice that walk <br>
        The real in you behind the veil, seducing with magnetism <br>
        that it made the escalator stop. <br><br>

        I might give it all up, If it were you taking me on <br>
        I might try moves I never played, and learn tricks I never knew. <br>
        I will win for you, I might kill for you. <br> <br>

        worked out on your primary emotion <br>
        The void echoed "Betrayal" <br>
        Those eyes looking into my soul; shrinking <br>
        Seeing past the mask of pretense to the soul of desire <br>
        responding to my shift in the world <br>
        Notes you hit talking or vibing, thumping your feet in sync with mine <br>
        Are you just playing or are you being genuine? <br><br>

        I still crave your glimpse in a room full of souls <br>
        sneaking some glares, maybe I'm pretending things <br>
        like how that Sun became moon that another misty afternoon <br>
        I; unconsciously moonstruck. disliking the part <br>
        you're right infront of me, yet so far away <br>
        you so different from others, like a rocket shooting off <br>
        on the loneliest journey at the far end of space <br>
        Always gazing at something beyond me. <br>
        Can never see me. <br><br>

        Looking at you, I am at the edge, falling <br>
        losing you for eternity; without even trying; <br>
        Maybe you're already down for someone else <br>
        Maybe you already have someone waiting on you <Br>
        If It's true, I am envious of her, but if it's not <br>
        It's honestly worse, cause, I am so timid, it actually hurts <br>
        How I'm letting you go <br><br>

        Maybe what you aim for, I've never really dreamed about <br>
        Why would you ever choose me, I dozed off wondering <br> <br>

        Wishing I had the courage to uncover the surface for you, <br>
        push your boundaries <br>
        and unveil your most intense desire, <br>
        most profound fears, the intrigue and the lust <br>
        the need for completion <br>
        that darkly seductive energy, A screen for projection <br>
        enigmatic intensity, forbidden and the unknown. <br><br>

        Rumours have it, you get attached scarily fast, <br>
        Tell me, does it hurt? <br>
        Do you feel lonely too? <br>
        Be a little easy on yourself <br>
        For once, try relinquishing some self conrol. <br>
        Try me as your home, <br>
        Before you sink back into your psychic depths; <br>
        seeing you from afar; <br>
        What if I can't make you mine <br>
        I will make you my poem <br>
        Before you slowly get obliterated from my mind <br>
        That similar winter is today <br>
        but Now I'm getting colder<br>
        Spellbounding, My ten hours, <br>
        and Ofcourse, yours. <br> <br> <br>
